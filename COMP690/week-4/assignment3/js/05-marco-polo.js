/* Marco! Polo!

Create an application which iterates numbers from 1 to 100. 
For multiples of 3, print "Marco!" instead of the number and for multiples of 5, print "Polo!" instead of the number. 
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print "Marco! Polo!". 
This is a VERY common JavaScript interview question and you should know how to do this. 
You will need to take advantage of the modulus operator to accomplish this task.
